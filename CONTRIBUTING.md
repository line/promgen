### Setting up Promgen for development

The Promgen repository has a Makefile with various commands to make development easier.
You can see some of the commands by running `make help`

If you are using an external database, you will want to create a `promgen` and `test_promgen`
database before running bootstrap or `make migrate` and `make test` will fail.

```bash
# If you need to install Python first, try using your system's package manager
# Examples
# yum install python3 python3-pip
# homebrew install python3
# If using OSX with Homebrew, you may need to export some flags
# to get mysql client to install
# export LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
make bootstrap
# If you want to enable DEBUG (and development mode)
echo 1 > ~/.config/promgen/DEBUG

# Amend bootstrapped configuration by hand: ~/.config/promgen/promgen.yml

# Setup or update database schemas, create initial user and shard
make migrate
# Run tests
make test
# Run development server
make run
```

For development and testing, it may be useful to make a symlink for running Promgen

```bash
# Example symlink
ln -s $PWD/.venv/bin/promgen ~/bin/promgen 
```

By default promgen listens on port `8000`. Login with the user `admin` and password `admin`.
Remember to change the password!

> Note: Promgen strives to be a standard Django application. Make sure to apply standard Django development patterns.

#### Custom Configuration Directory

By default `promgen` uses `~/.config/promgen` as its configuration directory.
This can be changed by setting the environment variable `PROMGEN_CONFIG_DIR` to an alternative location whenever calling `promgen ...` commands.
